# Lattice Structure Computation Program

This generates lattice structures from unit lattice meshes (.msh or ANSYS ASCII nodes + elements in .txt format)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pip install numpy
pip install progressbar2
GMSH installed and added to PATH
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.


Run the program by running in the project directory:

```
python app.py
```

Output files are placed in lattice\output in .stl and .msh format

## Running the tests

Go to the directory and run:
```
python unittest.py
```
